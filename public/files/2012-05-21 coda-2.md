Panic never ceases to amaze. 

Coda 2 is chalk full of, what look to be, amazing improvements. Live updating CSS will finally allow me to switch over from Espresso 2 (sorry [MacRabbit](http://macrabbit.com/), I do love you guys). Then throw in hints, git support, built-in MySQL editor, iCloud sync... I'm drooling.

But *then* on top of it all they throw in [Diet Coda](http://panic.com/dietcoda/): Coda for the iPad. It looks simply astounding. What's more, Diet Coda has "Air Preview", which allows you to use your iPad as a live preview of what you're coding on Coda 2. 

Mind.

Blown.

For the first 24 hours both apps will be half priced. They launch May 24 (Thursday). [Set your calendars.](http://panic.com/coda/codas.ics)
