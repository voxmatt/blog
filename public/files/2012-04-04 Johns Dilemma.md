Talking Points Memo sums it up:
> You’re the chief justice of the United States, and you’re presented with a choice: Either rebuke the political movement that gave you your dream job, or put your institution’s reputation on the line by neutering a sitting president’s signature legislation for the first time in 75 years.

I agree that this will likely be the moment by which history remembers the Chief Justice.
>“I see this as his legacy,” Lucas A. Powe Jr., a Supreme Court historian and professor of law at the University of Texas, Austin, told TPM. “This is really going to be a defining moment about whether he views himself as a member of a political coalition that is in power to impose its will on its country, or if he’s at least somebody that can rise above partisan politics.”

I'm not holding my breathe.
