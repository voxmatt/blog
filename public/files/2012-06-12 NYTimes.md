Let's say you want to read more than your monthly allotment of NYTimes.com articles, or you just have guilt pangs about letting such an important institution slowly wither and die. How would you go about signing up for a digital subscription?

If your response is, "just go to their website and sign up", oh how naive you are. You see, the *New York Times*, in its infinite wisdom, has constructed a labyrinth of options for you to decode, ponder over, and pull out your hair trying to figure out.

Fortunately, I have done the leg work for you. If you want to get a full digital subscription (meaning you can access everything on your computer, smartphone, or iPad), the cheapest option is (drumroll please): **Sunday Delivery**.[^1] Yes, that is correct, the cheapest way to get a digital subscription is by ordering a physical copy of the paper. This makes *total* sense.

[^1]: To clarify: yes, Sunday delivery gets you 24/7 digital access, not just Sunday access. The trick here is that *all* paper delivery gets *full* digital access.
