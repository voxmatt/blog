Title: Under Construction
---

After much hemming and hawing, I've decided to start writing online again. Hence, the absence of my lame place-holder about.me profile for this URL, and the mess you currently see. 

I hope to elaborate on this in a future post, but for a variety of somewhat nerdy reasons, I've decided to move away from WordPress and Tumblr and give Scriptogr.am a whirl. It's core functionality is exactly what I'm working for (and saves me from building the underpinnings myself), but it's a bit rough around the edges, so it's taking a bit longer than I expected to whip it into the form I'm looking for.

In the meantime, welcome; come back often.
