I've been thinking about this blog for a long time.

In March of 2005 I started a blog called [MN Publius](http://mnpublius.com/). I started it after I interned in the Washington D.C. office of then Senator Mark Dayton.[^1] It was a wonderful experience and when I returned to school I wanted to sustain that political engagement somehow. A friend suggested a blog; a political blog. I didn't even read many blogs at the time.

When I started, the act of writing online was like shouting into a vast, echoless abyss. But it was oddly cathartic. And I found that the act of writing helped clarify my thinking. Arguments became positions; thoughts became ideas. At the same time, however, I also obsessed about gaining traffic and currying favor.

We did gain traffic and even curried some favor. And I made some great friends along the way. It's nothing I regret, not in the least, but at some point the game of it became, simply, it. The writing became a tool instead of an end. Whenever I wrote something I fretted about the implications—who would take this what way, how many nasty emails will I get, what friendships do I threaten ... so I simply stopped writing.

MN Publius simply isn't mine anymore. Jeff Rosenberg took the reigns and he's done a great job with it, but he's made it into *his* blog—as every good blogger should. I still read it and enjoy it, but I need a clean slate.

I've been thinking about this blog for a long time because I've wanted to return to the act of writing. It's hard to explain, but writing simply makes me feel better. That also means, however, that this blog will be very self-centered—the URL isn't an accident. Fortunately, I don't mean that this blog will be self-centered like this post is (I'm not one for writing about myself under most circumstances), but in that I'm not going to chase traffic or favor this time. This time, I'm just going to write.

[^1]: I should write about this experience sometime. I truly believe that Mark's Senatorial career was a failure because of his idealism and integrity. It was astounding how those characteristics looked like bumbling incompetence from afar once they were twisted through the lens of D.C. handshake politics.
