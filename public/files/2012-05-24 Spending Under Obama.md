This needs to be sung from the mountain tops:

> We found that Obama has indeed presided over the slowest growth in spending of any president using raw dollars, and the growth on his watch was the second-slowest if you adjust for inflation. The math simultaneously backs up Nutting’s calculations and demolishes Romney’s contention. The only significant shortcoming of the graphic was that it failed to note that some of the restraint in spending was fueled by demands from congressional Republicans. On balance, we rated the claim Mostly True.

Look, this isn't even on my top-ten list of reasons why Obama should be reelected, but it instantly obliterates the number-one misconception held by all his detractors. Obama is not, I repeat *is not* ,wildly expanding the size of Government. 

We can have a discussion about a variety of substantive issues, but the above is a fact—it is not a topic for debate.
