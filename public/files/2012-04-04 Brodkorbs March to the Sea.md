This story is far from over:

> Legal costs are mounting at the public's expense even before former high-ranking state Senate staffer Michael Brodkorb sues over his dismissal.

> The Senate has hired an outside attorney to protect the institution's interest and defuse fallout from Brodkorb's admitted extramarital affair with then-Senate Majority Leader Amy Koch. But officials are so far refusing to disclose the contract or the hourly rate of Dayle Nolan, who works for a large Minneapolis law firm.

> And Nolan's fees are probably just the start.

Brodkorb has put the Senate in a very tricky spot. There's no doubt they must lawyer-up, but dragging out the fight will only bring more attention to the matter. And from what I've heard, I don't think the Senate GOP wants more attention brought to this matter.

Now, it's one thing for public dollars to be spent defending a lawsuit against a public official and/or bodyâ€”of course we'd all prefer this be avoided, but that's just a cost of doing business in today's world. It's another thing entirely for the public to foot the bill for a fight that was initiated due to an internal leadership battle and personal power plays. 

As I've said before, I don't think the story here is the salacious relationship, but the brutality of the GOP's internal leadership politics.
