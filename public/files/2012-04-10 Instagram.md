The big news yesterday was that [facebook has agreed to acquire Instagram](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100318398827991) for $1 billion in cash and stock.

Instagram is interesting to me for a variety of reasons. First, the self-taught, quick-to-pivot, lean-startup lore of its founder (and later founder*s*) is wonderfully inspirational. But MG has a good write-up of that story [at Paris Lemon](http://parislemon.com/post/20833947117/one-burbn-one-scotch-one-beer). Second, it's truly amazing that a start-up can *still* enter a saturated market and, in only 2 years, build something that truly scares the biggest social network in the world. But TechCrunch has an [okay write-up](http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/instagram-story-facebook-acquisition/) of that story. Third, the $1 billion valuation (more than *The New York Times* is worth) seems, well, a bit much. But you can find that story pretty much everywhere.

The only thing I have to add to this story is my personal experience. I rarely post photos to facebook; I played with hipstamatic and got bored; I used Camera+ for some time but eventually ditched it; and yet, Instagram somehow found a place. 

Initially I balked (*another* photo app with silly filters?) and condescendinly shrugged off the Instagram photos I saw in my facebook stream (a fire hydrant? you're such an artist...). But the experience of using the app is so different from the expectation. Instagram feels quick and ephemeral. Unlike facebook where posting a picture feels permanent and monumental, Instagram feels like *now*—as though I'm merely sharing what I see in the world at this moment. 

It's not weighted down by judgments or introspection—a photo gets to simply be a photo. And that's pretty fun. You start to look at everything around you a *little* bit differently. And by doing so, you start to notice things you previously just passed by. That's a pretty amazing accomplishment for one little app.

But part of Instagram's magic is that *it's not facebook*. I've always advocated turning off automatic cross-posting to facebook from Instagram because they're simply different streams. Sure, on occasion I want to share an Instagram pic with my facebook friends, but that's the exception, not the rule.

Which leads me to my conclusion: this acquisition seems to be great for Instagram, okay for facebook, but bad for current Instagram users. I hope I'm proven wrong.
