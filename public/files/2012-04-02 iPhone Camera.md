My Answer: Yes (unless you're a professional photographer).

This is actually an interesting question that you see rearing its head  with each subsequent iteration of the iPhone, and the corresponding bump in camera quality. The reality is that for most people the iPhone is, functionally, their only camera. Whether or not the iPhone can compare with a good point-and-shoot[^1], it's long since surpassed the threshold where it's "good enough." 

If I always have my iPhone on me, why carry another object? And given that default of having a great camera in my pocket at all times, will I even remember to grab the extra camera when the occasion calls for it?

Probably not.

[^1]: In my experience, the iPhone 4S is legitimately as good as a nice point-and-shoot in ideal lighting. However, when you get into low light or really bright light, the small lens just can't hold up to anything with more glass (and a better flash). Take a step up from a point-and-shoot to something like a Sony NEX 7 (my standby), and the iPhone can no longer compare. But now we're talking about anoher $700 and a lot of bulk, compared with what you already had in your pocket.
