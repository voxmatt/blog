This ad doesn't resonate with me at all, but it's not supposed to. It's clearly aimed at the small segment of undecided voters and those who may not have thought critically about the amendment yet. But I'm still not sure about how well it hits that segment. Two immediate reactions:

1. Opening with the fact that Kim & John are Republicans and Catholic feels disingenuous. I'm sure it's true, but it frames them as cherry-picked spokespeople ("hey, check this out: we found two Republican Catholics to stump for us"). I'd like to hear from *them* that they go to Catholic church and voted for John McCain.
2. Everyone needs to understand that this amendment doesn't make gay marriage legal; no matter how it turns out. You're not voting on making gay marriage legal, you're voting on using the Minnesota Constitution to stamp out the discussion.

That being said, MN United is run by great people and there's no doubt that they've thought through this more than I have.
