>The U.S. economy was supposed to be slow and unsteady in early 2012. Retailers are proving otherwise.

>For the fourth consecutive month, major retail chains reported better-than-expected sales numbers, the latest sign that Americans are gaining confidence in the economic recovery and are ready to spend more.

>Overall, 20 major retailers said on Thursday that sales at stores open for at least a year rose 3.9 percent in March; analysts expected 3.3 percent.

This is why the [retail job numbers](http://mattmart.in/post/bad-news-120k-jobs) are so odd.

**Update**: Zack Stephenson posts an interesting thought [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/zackstephenson/status/188275280928964609): "I think the seasonal adjustments are screwed up due to the funky weather. I suspect more jobs were added in Mar, less in Jan & Feb."
