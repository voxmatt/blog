The only thing keeping me from using Sparrow is one Exchange account I need for work (it doesn't support Exchange). I may be one of the few people who view the lack of push as a feature—one less distraction.

It's a beautiful app (although it could use a better icon). I recommend [taking it for a spin](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sparrow/id492573565?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4).
