Title: Gaming and the Apple TV
Date: 2013-02-21 09:25

I was watching the live stream of Sony's PS4 announcement on [The Verge](http://live.theverge.com/sony-playstation-4-event-live-blog/)  yesterday and kept thinking, *this* is "next-gen"? To me it feels an awful lot like "this-gen."

Let me enumerate a few things that feel far too "this-gen":

- Physical media
- Consoles bigger than cable boxes with fans louder than PCs circa 2000
- $60 for new-release games (if that — they didn't announce PS4 game pricing)
- A $300-400 price of admission (no official pricing yet, but no news is bad news here)
- Isolation from my mobile devices (and, no, I do not count the PS Vita as one of "my" mobile devices)

Today's event did nothing to address any of the above.[^touch] Instead, the event made it clear that Sony is completely unsure of how to evolve in the living room.

Which got be thinking about Apple. With an SDK that allows it to expand into an iOS gaming platform, the Apple TV could address all those issues. 

Gaming seems like a formidable opportunity for Apple; the Apple TV has iPhone level hardware, it runs iOS, it can process payments with mindless simplicity, and Apple has leagues of iOS developers at the ready. But there are two major hardware obstacles with the Apple TV as a gaming device that I have yet to see anyone discuss. 

**Obstacle 1: Have you tried doing anything with the Apple TV remote?**

I have no interest in playing a game controlled by that thing; at least not once the novelty wears off after 30 seconds.

The obvious solution is an iOS based controller. That's an expensive controller, but a lot of people have iPhones and a lot of kids already have iPod Touches, so this may work. But it's not entirely optimal. As anyone who has used the iOS remote for the Apple TV knows, neither pairing nor tracking are entirely reliable.

The second solution is some kind of peripheral. I deem this to be the much, much better solution, but surely Apple feels that buttons are not the future; are they pragmatic enough to ship a controller anyway? My bets are no. But let's suspend disbelief for a moment, because the idea is tantalizing. Apple already has my payment and shipping information tied to my Apple ID. Imagine launching the new Apple TV game store and being prompted to buy a $40 gamepad — instant upgrade, one click.

The third route is just opening the store and seeing what developers do. Some may suffer through the remote, some may lean on 3rd party peripherals, and some may lean on other iOS devices. I actually see this as more likely than an Apple gamepad, but it still seems inelegant and cumbersome.

**Obstacle 2: Big Games are Big**

Both "next-gen" systems are expected to incorporate Blu-Ray. While this may seem antiquated, it's important for one reason alone: games are huge and getting huger. It stinks downloading a 10 GB game[^size] and it takes up tons of hard drive space to do so (my GTA IV *save file* is over 1 GB alone).

The current Apple TV is a streaming device; it has 8 GB of flash for cacheing movie files as they download. This is woefully insufficient for local storage of multiple games. Apple could either (1) develop a game-streaming system of some kind (Sony announced that you will be able to begin playing a game as it downloads on the PS4) or (2) ship bigger Apple TVs. I don't believe they could allow game developers any significant portion of the existing 8 GB because that is required for cacheing streaming media.

Shipping larger Apple TVs seems like somewhat of an inevitability, but without a streaming service for games, how big is big enough? Well, if you *don't* plan on supporting large, 10 GB blockbuster titles, iOS devices have proven that 16 GB is sufficient for many people.

**Wrap-Up**

Which brings me to my final point. If Apple goes the route of offering an SDK for the current Apple TV (or an evolutionary iteration thereof) without an Apple gamepad, I don't see this being a device aimed at big blockbuster games. Instead, I think the first year of such a device would be very much an Angry Birds experience as developers wrestle with the interface problem (and to a lester extent, the storage problem).

I believe this would be enough to put a dent in console sales, but it seems that mobile devices have already removed casual gamers from the conceivable market of these "next-gen" systems anyway. To stop more serious gamers like me from buying a console (to put next to my Apple TV), Apple would need to go after the big blockbuster games, which means a beefier Apple TV with a gamepad. And, again, I put those odds next to an iPhone with a keyboard.

Therefore, I think the Apple TV's prospects as a console *killer* are overstated.[^consoles]

Now, there was a big "if" up above: *if* Apple goes the SDK route for the current Apple TV. Who knows, maybe they have a new device up their sleeve that will blow my mind. It wouldn't be the first time.

[^touch]: I don't think a touchpad on my Dual Shock is going to change that.
[^size]: I couldn't find evidence that anyone's shipped a 2 Blu-Ray game yet, but there are a number of 3 DVD 360 games.
[^consoles]: I do believe that this round of systems (a) will be the last of consoles as we know them, and (b) will not be as successful as the last round. Mobile devices (tablets included) have put too much of a dent in the user base. That being said, I would not be surprised to see Microsoft introduce an xbox lite, of sorts, alongside the full console — something geared at downloadable games only and media consumption. Depending on the experience and pricing, that could potentially pull the consoles out of their current morass.
