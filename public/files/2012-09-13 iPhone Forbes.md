This is actually on Forbes.com, I kid you not:

> Letâ€™s break that down in terms of total cost with the cheapest version of each accessory:

> iPhone 5: $199 (base 16GB unit with contract)
> Case: $50
> Car Charger: $10
> Stereo Dock: $100
> Armband: $10

> Minimum Total Cost: $369

No, the *minimum* total cost is $199 + contract + tax. The cost of re-buying an iPhone *and* all your stupid accessories instead of getting a $39 adapter is, apparently, $369.

Forbes.com has become the Geo Cities of journalism.
