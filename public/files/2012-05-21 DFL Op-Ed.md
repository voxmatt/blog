House Minority Leader Paul Thissen pens a great op-ed in the Strib today:

> In 2010, Republicans promised an end to "business as usual" if they were elected. Yet the last two years have been marked by their striking unwillingness to compromise, which led to gridlock and the longest state government shutdown in our history.

> Republican House Majority Leader Matt Dean even bragged that the Republicans "won the shutdown" -- ignoring the fact that 19,000 Minnesotans were laid off, state parks were closed and Minnesota's reputation as a "state that works" was tarnished.

> The Republicans ran on a platform of fiscal responsibility, but failed to deliver. The budget they passed to end the shutdown borrowed record amounts, including $2.7 billion from our schools, and for the first time in state history engaged in Washington D.C.-style deficit spending to cover up the state's budget hole by borrowing from future state revenues.

Rep. Thissen sums it up:

 > In the end, the 2011-12 Legislature will be remembered for misplaced priorities and missed opportunities.
 
 The whole thing is definitely worth reading.
