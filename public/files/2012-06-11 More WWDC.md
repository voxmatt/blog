1. What are [all the TBA sessions](http://daringfireball.net/2012/05/reading_way_too_much_into_wwdc_schedule) about and why are there so many more this year if no super-secret-Apple-TV-SDK was announced?
2. What the hell is with the Mac Pro update? Look, I couldn't care less, but I'm [with Marco](http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/11/3078180/apple-incrementally-updates-mac-pro-desktop-for-2012): why even bother? Unlike Marco, that's not said with bile, that's an honest question. It almost feels like a last-minute stop-gap.
