> Google Inc.  is close to a deal to pay $22.5 million to settle charges related to its surreptitious bypassing of the privacy settings of millions of Apple Inc. users, according to officials briefed on the settlement terms.

> The fine is expected to be the largest penalty ever levied on a single company by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. It offers the latest sign of the FTC's stepped-up approach to policing online privacy violations, coming just six months after The Wall Street Journal reported on Google's practices.

Reaction as a consumer: Who cares if it's the biggest fine ever, $22.5M is insultingly low for violating the privacy of millions of citizens.

Reaction as a JD: Let's see what non-monetary terms the FTC has negotiated into the settlement.
