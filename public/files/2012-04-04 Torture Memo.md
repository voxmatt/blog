George Washington University and Wired got their hands on a 2006 memo by Secretary of State Aide, Philip Zelikow, dissenting to the Bush Torture Memo.

> As the National Security Archive explains, the memo “concludes that because they violate the Constitutional ban on ‘cruel and unusual punishment,’ the CIA techniques of ‘waterboarding, walling, dousing, stress positions, and cramped confinement’ were ‘the techniques least likely to be sustained’ by the courts.”

> Zelikow wrote that they were “unaware of any precedent in World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, or any subsequent conflict for authorized, systematic interrogation practices similar to those in question here, even where the prisoners were presumed to be unlawful combatants.”

Forever a stain on our Nation.
