Very, *very* interesting.

> RubyMotion is a revolutionary toolchain for iOS. 
It lets you quickly develop and test native iOS applications for iPhone or iPad, all using the awesome Ruby language you know and love.

Of note is the fact that it's by Laurent Sansonetti, the creator of MacRuby. (via [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/))
