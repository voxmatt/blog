Our car has an additional 2,000 miles on the odometer. We have a new set of keys in hand. Partially unpacked boxes litter the our new loft-chic cement floors. And shells of Ikea particle board are gradually forming.

My wife and I are, slowly, becoming residents of San Francisco.

In addition to forwarding addresses, this move is symbolic of a lot of personal changes. I will *always* be a Minnesotan, and I have every intention of returning, but change sometimes needs to be embraced. And right now, I'm open arms.
