I've seen these stats before, but they blow my mind everytime.

> According to CIRP’s data, Apple sold 15 percent of all iPhones purchased in the U.S. during the period of the survey (retail, 11 percent; online, 4 percent). Meanwhile, AT&T sold 32 percent via its online and retail stores; Verizon, 30 percent — again, online and off — and Sprint, 7 percent.

> And Best Buy? The big-box retailer sold 13 percent, just 2 percent shy of Apple itself. 

Not having to walk into an AT&T store is one of the top-10 reasons I love my iPhone. Seriously.
