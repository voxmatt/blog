>For every friend you invite that installs Dropbox, you’ll both get 500 MB of free space. If you’ve got a free account, you can invite up to 32 people for a whopping total of 16 GB of extra space.

I saw this a couple days ago, but what I didn't realize is that the bump up in credit is applied retroactively as well. That. Is. Awesome.

If you don't use Dropbox, you should. It's the ultimate back-up (my most important files are in my Dropbox), it's mindlessly easy sync, it's a great way to share, and increasingly it does extra-amazing things like powering this blog. Oh, and if you sign-up [via this link](http://db.tt/GSpm6jvV), I get a sweet, sweet 500 mb.
