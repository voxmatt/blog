This is from the obituary of Count Robert de La Rochefoucauld, a Frenchman who was involved in the resistance during WWII.

> En route to his execution in Auxerre, La Rochefoucauld made a break, leaping from the back of the truck carrying him to his doom, and dodging the bullets fired by his two guards. Sprinting through the empty streets, he found himself in front of the Gestapoâ€™s headquarters, where a chauffeur was pacing near a limousine bearing the swastika flag. Spotting the key in the ignition, La Rochefoucauld jumped in and roared off, following the Route Nationale past the prison he had left an hour earlier.

The whole obituary is like this. Someone needs to make a movie.
