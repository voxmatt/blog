The New York Times reports on the continued resiliance of whiskey rock sales. I couldn't agree more with one bar tender they interviewed:

>“It’s idiotic,” said Dale DeGroff, a noted mixologist who is partial to Glenlivet 12 with big square ice. “You won’t see them at the bar unless they are making fun of them.”

Ice is perfect as is. It *solves* two problems at once: dilution and chilling. Now, too much dilution is a small problem, so if you're particular about these things I *highly* recommend the [Tovolo King Cube Ice Trays](http://www.amazon.com/Tovolo-KING-Cube-Trays-Blue/dp/B00395FHRO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1334161876&sr=8-1). Not only are these handy, but you look like a real pro when you pour a drink for a friend. Of course, good Scotch just needs a little water.

Also, while I'm ranting, everyone should read this: [Old Fashioned 101](http://oldfashioned101.com/).
