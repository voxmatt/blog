> On Tuesday, MinnPost's Sharon Schmickle presented data from the 2011 tax incidence study. She wrote: “Pull together every state and local tax Minnesotans pay and you clearly can see that the households with the highest incomes pay the lowest effective tax rates.” That is, our state and local tax systems, when taken together, are regressive. 

>Minnesota is not unusual in this regard; only one state, according to the Department of Revenue, had a progressive state/local tax system and Minnesota was about average in terms of regressivity. Unfortunately, the regressivity of Minnesota’s state and local taxes increased between 1990 and today, with our system being roughly neutral (neither progressive nor regressive) in 1990 and becoming more regressive over time.

Clearly, it's an outrage that the rich still have to pay taxes at all.
