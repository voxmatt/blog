Do yourself a favor, don't click through to this one. 

I know it should come as no surprise that Lyons has published yet another piece of link-bait garbage, but even by Dan Lyons standards, this one was ... remarkable. 

>So thanks, Instagram, for creating a piece of software that lets 30 million pretentious douchetards uglify every site on the Web with their horrific eye-manure.

And only a few paragraphs later:

>I think this whole argument about Apple-vs-Android is overblown, not to mention stupid, boring and juvenile. 

He's actually serious.
