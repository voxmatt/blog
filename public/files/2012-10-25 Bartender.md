Bartender is a little app that allows you to move Mac menubar items into a sub-menu. So instead of having a stream of icons that stretch half way across your menu bar, you have a a clean set with a little ellipses instead. You can even put the notification center icon in the Bartender sub-menuâ€”awesome.
