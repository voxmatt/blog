There are obviously *many* interesting things that happened at [WWDC today](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2012/), but there's one that I've been unable to stop thinking about.

Why a "Next Generation" MacBook Pro and not simply the New MacBook Pro? Why an *additional* product? 

After all, Apple is known both for its laser-like focus and its willingness to abandon legacy tech. If Apple believes that this model is the future of the MacBook Pro[^1], which it clearly does, it would seem much more Apple-like[^2] to simply move the whole line over to this new model. 

The reason why they didn't is, of course, pretty clear: the "Next Generation" MacBook Pro is pricey. But this answer only begs the more interesting question: why then did they not wait for the price of the components to come down enough to make a whole product-line switch economical?

My guess is two-fold:

1. There are people willing to pay for the "Next Generation" MacBook Pro *now*, even if it isn't practical to force all MacBook Pro consumers to gut the new price.
2. More importantly, Mac developers and web gurus need plenty of advance warning about what a Retina display Mac is going to look like. Unlike iOS, Apple doesn't have the same leverage within the Mac developer community to force rapid change. And they have even less leverage to do so within the web development community. Although I haven't seen one, my bet is that non-Retina graphics look *worse* on a Retina Mac than they do on a standard resolution Mac.

That all being said, I assume that Apple believes that Retina displays will be economical in the near future for all Macs. Because the Retina display on the "Next Generation" MacBook Pro going to be physical reminder to every Apple Store customer that a game-changing update to the regular-ol' MacBook Pro and/or MacBook Air is surely on its way.[^3]

[^1]: And to the extent we're talking about retina displays, the future of all Macs.
[^2]: I hate people who try to say what is "Apple-like", and therefore, I now hate myself just a bit.
[^3]: I'd guess that the "Next Generation" MacBook Pro has a significant suppressive effect on MacBook Pro sales but a limited, if even measurable, effect on MacBook Air sales.
