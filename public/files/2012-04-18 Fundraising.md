I know all this information has been trickling in over the last week, but *all* the Q1 fundraising numbers are now in.

First, a few ground rules: (1) it's still really early; (2) incumbants have a huge advantage; (3) primaries are still looming; (4) candidates in a primary have a huge by-stander fundraising problem; (5) national money will be huge in most of these races but most national PACs are still relatively quiet; and (6) fundraising isn't everything.

With that said, let's take a look.

**Senate**

- Klobuchar (D): $983K raised, $5200K on hand
- Hegseth (R): $160K raised, $130K on hand
- Severson (R): $54K raised, $40K on hand
- Bills (R): $45K raised, $34 on hand

The only real question in this race is which Republican will have the honor of getting beat by Senator Klobuchar and how embarrassingly wide her margin will be. So I'll be honest: I haven't been paying any attention to this race. That being said, Hegseth only entered in March (as did Bills), and he managed to raise far more than either of his opponents. Take that for what you will.

**CD1**

- Walz (D): $217K raised, $708K on hand
- Quist (R): $38K raised, $59K on hand
- Parry (R): $17K raised, $36 on hand

See my [earlier post](http://mattmart.in/post/why-rep.-walz-will-still-be-rep.-walz-come-december) on this. Summary: Walz will win this one, but let's keep our guard up. As for who the challenger will be, my money's on Parry.

**CD2**

- Kline (R): $255K raised, $1000K on hand

I've heard that recruiting a challenger in CD2 has been tough. There are three announced Democrats, but they have yet to really get their campaigns off the ground. CD2 is the only congressional district that moved in the DFL direction due to redistricting, but the change was modest. I do think it makes this district more interesting down the road, but unless the national climate shifts, I don't think this is the year.

**CD3, 4, 5, 6, and 7**

I'm sorry, but who cares. The incumbant will win in all four of these districts. I'll let you guess as to what the fundraising looks like.

**CD8**

- Cravaack (R): $246K raised, $629K on hand
- Clark (D): $321K raised, $418K on hand
- Nolan (D): $77K raised, $40K on hand
- Anderson (D): $38K raised, $20K on hand

Now *this* is interesting. Clark actually managed to out-strip incumbant Congressman Chip Cravaack in fundraising this quarter. Not only is Clark a challenger, but she's facing a heated primary battle (she announced last month that she will not abide by the endorsement). It's worth noting, however, that her bottom line was helped out significantly by national groups EMILY's List ($82K) and ActBlue PAC ($91K). Without those two, her total would have been under Cravaack's but still almost twice Nolan's. Either way, the national support is indicative of the increasing air of presumptiveness behind Clark's candidacy. 

I have to admit, on the balance, I'm a bigger fan of Nolan, but Clark has always been a tremendously impressive campaigner. This is the only seat with a real chance of changing parties this cycle. Cravaack should be scared.
