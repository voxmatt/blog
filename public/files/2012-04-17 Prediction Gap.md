Fascinating:

> A new CNN/ORC International poll released Monday underscored the skepticism an overwhelming majority of voters feel about the putative GOP nominee's chances against the president. Sixty-one percent of respondents, when asked who they think will win in the fall regardless of which candidate they support, picked the current White House occupant. Only 35 percent thought Romney would claim victory.

> The 26-point margin is eye-popping. In early September of 2008, only an 8-point difference separated Barack Obama from John McCain (a race that ended in an actual margin of victory Obama will be hard-pressed to replicate this time around). It's also a departure from the bipartisan consensus of most of Washington, which predicts a neck-and-neck race between the president and GOP nominee. 

This poll merely reflects the mood of the country at this moment—I doubt the gap will be large if it starts to look like Romney *is* winning—but it's an interesting mood to reflect on. Perhaps it foreshadows GOP enthusiasm gap problems, but it's just too early to tell.
