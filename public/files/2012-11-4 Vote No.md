On May 21, 2011, on an unexpectedly beautiful Minnesota afternoon[^1], I stood in front of a small sea of smiling faces.[^2]  Standing across from me, looking breathtakingly beautiful, the love of my life, and now, formally, my wife.

In many ways, little changed on our wedding day. Ashley and I loved each other as much before as we did after; the marriage required no move, no consolidation of things; we had met all of each other&rsquo;s relatives and friends; and because the marriage license had been signed moments earlier, we were legally already husband and wife when we stepped to the altar. And yet, the significance of that moment was, and is, unparalleled in my life. In front of everyone we hold dear, we declared our lifelong commitment to each other and our undying love. We did it without any apologies or conditions — we did it fully.

And that&rsquo;s really what this is all about, at least to me: love without apologies, footnotes, or asterisks.

Marriage is society&rsquo;s most significant recognition of love and, perhaps, the most significant social convention we still regularly share.

It is impossible, then, to deny a class of individuals access to that convention without necessarily relegating them to a different class of societal recognition.[^3] No matter the replacement, be it civil unions or something else, denying access to marriage on the basis of who one loves, takes that love — that *love* of two consenting adults — and marks it with an asterisk, with otherness. It is a deeply cruel and cynical thing to do to one&rsquo;s brother or sister.

There are so many reasons to vote no — to leave discrimination out of our state&rsquo;s constitution; to send a message to the country that, yes, Minnesota *is* different; to remind those who remain frightened in the shadows that there are those who find their love as beautiful as anyone else&rsquo;s; to improve our state&rsquo;s economy; to keep this ongoing conversation open; to steer our state&rsquo;s course into line with the trajectory of history — but the primary reason is because it celebrates that most amazing gift of our all-too-brief, all-too-precious lives: the committed love of one for another. 

That gift, for those who are lucky enough to find it, should be celebrated loudly, without any apologies, or half-steps, or asterisks, in front of a small sea of smiling faces.

[^1]: *Numerous* weather forecasters accurately predicted that it would rain torrentially the evening of the rehearsal dinner, through the night, and well into the morning of the wedding. But, miraculously, the forecasters turned out to be very wrong about the afternoon. The skies cleared just long enough to dry off the grass and allow for our outdoor ceremony. The clouds returned shortly after we left the altar.
[^2]: Having one&rsquo;s whole world within a field of view is simply remarkable. It is at once humbling and empowering.
[^3]: A vote against the marriage amendment preserves the status quo and the status quo in Minnesota is that two persons of the same gender cannot get married. It seems that many Minnesotans mistakenly believe that they will be voting on allowing same-sex couples to marry. 
    From a strategic point of view, then, this simple fact seems advantageous.  If we can teach undecided voters that a no vote is, essentially, just a punt, isn&rsquo;t that an easier fight to win? 
    It&rsquo;s this line of reasoning that has led me to make this argument on occasion, telling persuadable voters to &ldquo;vote no to continue the conversation&rdquo; or to &ldquo;vote no to keep the status quo&rdquo; or ... some other intellectually flaccid garbage.
    While the argument is factually truthful, it *feels* tremendously dishonest. It feels dishonest because it implies that I, and other opponents of the amendment, are merely disinterested bystanders; philosophers interested only in continuing an interesting societal conversation. But most of us care very deeply.
    Others have done an excellent job of citing arguments for why an undecided voter should vote no. For example, [this article does a nice job](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-michaelson/straight-talk-about-gay-marriage-4-points-for-undecided-voters-to-consider_b_2047589.html). But in the above essay I wanted to clearly state why I care so deeply about this vote.
