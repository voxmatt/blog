Marco's thoughts are, as usual, well-reasoned and insightful. But his conclusion is very much tied to his use pattern.

From the post I gather that Marco regularly needs to process checks. I don't. In fact, a check is a rarity these days. And it used to be a very obnoxious rarity. No matter how close a US Bank branch or ATM was, having to make that trip was a pain. I'd constantly put it off, and then when I finally remembered to bring the check with me, I'd inevitably forget to make the stop.

Now it takes me 2 minutes on my iPhone. Sure, maybe that's 1:30 longer than it *could* take with a better built app, but it's about 15 minutes shorter than it used to take; and a whole lot less hassle.

For my use pattern, that's progress in a big way.
