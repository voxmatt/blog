Title: Thoughts on a Garage Sale

My wife recently matched for her pediatrics residency in California. We currently live in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and have for the last four years. So this is a big change and requires a big move. I'll actually be writing a bit more about this change as it will likely also mean that I am making a significant career change as well. But right now I want to write about a something much more mundane: garage sales.

There are two categories of topics to discuss here: (1) tips on the actual process of holding a garage sale, and (2) larger revelations that unexpectedly follow from holding a garage sale.

**Tips for Holding a Garage Sale**

1. Advertise, advertise, advertise. You are about to embark upon one of life's most miserable projects, so make sure you can kill it with one shot. Put up a post on Craigslist. Put up teaser signs along major thorough-fares in your area (e.g. "Garage sale this Saturday!"). Even buy a small ad in your paper. You really can't do too much advertising—the more people that show up at your sale, the better.
2. Garage sale ≠ garbage day. If you wouldn't feel good about donating the item, toss it, don't sell it. On the other side of the spectrum, you have to be willing to sell some items that you feel bad about selling. If you don't ever use it, sell it and don't feel bad about the fact that it was a gift from Auntie May.
3. Pricing is hard. A decent starting point is 30% of what you bought it for if it's still in near perfect condition. Brand name furniture (Ikea, Room & Board, etc.) can be sold for a little over 50% or more if it's in good condition. But these are guidelines, not rules. The bottom line is how badly you want to get rid of it. Never want to see it again? Time to slash the price. But it's also okay to put a higher price on something you *may* want to keep.
4. Pricing is hard, but price it you must! "Make me an offer" is a good way to waste time not selling something. People are generally much more comfortable browsing and only speaking up when they see a deal they're willing to make.
5. Give yourself ample time. Sorting through your back-log of crap takes longer than you'd expect. Sorting it, pricing it, and arranging it takes even longer. 
6. Open early. If it's a weekday, this probably means 6 a.m. If it's a weekend (which it probably should be), 10 a.m. is probably fine, but make sure to note the time then in your ads.

**Life Lessons I Learned From Holding a Garage Sale**

1. Your stuff is worth jack-squat. You know that Ikea desk you bought for $190? Its worth dropped to $100 the second the return-period ran out. It really is somewhat of a healthy reminder of the perils of consumerism—time spent acquiring is really time spent throwing money out the window. Which brings me to:
2. If you can, only buy stuff you really like. I'm done buying cheap utility items (read: Ikea furniture). Once you're out of college, you likely have time to save up for items you truly care about. So you don't have a couch at your new place for a couple months, who cares; if you wait it out to find something you love, you'll not only be happier for the remaining life of that couch, but you'll save money in the long run when you inevitably find it's time to "upgrade" from that crappy utility buy you made. Which brings me to:
3. Garage sales and Craigslist are a buyer's best friend. Almost all the furniture I sold this week was like new, and I sold almost all of it at half of retail price. This is the upside of point #1: you can get *great* stuff for way less than you would at a store. But keep in mind point #2: you have to be willing to take your time. For every gem on Craigslist, there's 20 total pieces of crap. 
4. You should really meet the people in your neighborhood. Odds are that they're just like you: nice, interesting people who have simply been too busy or timid to reach out and introduce themselves. After 4 years of living next door to these people, we met them because of a moving sale! What a waste.
