Erin McKean writes about her experience editing David Foster Wallace's note for the Oxford American Writer's Thesaurus in the linked to article. A wonderful little piece that is well worth your time.

Also at the bottom of Erin's piece is a list of notes by author. Many of these notes are included in the OS X thesaurus and there's been a [bit](http://www.davemadden.org/blog/2011/07/a-discovery/) of a [hullabaloo](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/08/21/dfw-word-notes) surrounding this latent discovery. It's well deserved too, because these little notes are just delightful. 

For example, this is only the very first note listed by Erin. The word "aghast" by the author David Auburn:

> Nothing conveys a horrified reaction better, because the whispery, gasping sound of the word personalizes it, seems to locate the horror in the victim's frozen, ghost-pale face, in their paralyzing intake of breath.

Excuse me, I have quite a few more entries to read...
