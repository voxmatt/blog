I highly doubt you're hearing it here first, but I feel obliged to share that Mountain Lion is [now available in the App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-mountain-lion/id537386512?mt=12) for $20.

An OS upgrade for $20 that can be downloaded the day it is released with the click of a button... wonderful. Distribution through the Mac App Store has allowed Apple to accelerate releases and focus on incremental refinements instead of major releases that require headline features to justify the price. Don't get me wrong, I think Apple will role out headline features when they think they're legitimately useful, but no more Front Row, just for the sake of it.

Gruber, as usual, [provides](http://daringfireball.net/2012/07/mountain_lion) an insightful quip:

>That mindset and development schedule — “What can we do to make this nicer by next year?” — may well be the most important thing from iOS that Apple has taken back to the Mac.
