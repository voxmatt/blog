Summary:

- Only 120,000 jobs were added in March, down from over 200,000 in each of the previous three months.
- And while the unemployment is at the lowest since January 2009 (8.2%), the rate dropped because fewer people searched for jobs.
- Still, the last four months have been the best four months of hiring in two years.

But when you drill down into the numbers, they start to look a bit ... weird:

> Retailers seemed hurt most in March. They shed nearly 34,000 jobs in March after cutting nearly 29,000 in February. Temporary help firms dropped almost 8,000 â€” a potentially bad sign for the job market because companies often hire temp workers before adding full timers.

> But Chan was more encouraged by healthy job growth in industries that are sensitive to changes in the economy: Manufacturers added 37,000 jobs, and hotels and restaurants added 39,000.

> Government hiring was little changed in March, a positive sign after months of job cuts and the state and local level.

Look, I switched my major from economics to government half-way through micro-economics 101, so take my thoughts with an over-sized grain of salt. But it strikes me as odd that retail was hit the hardest at a time when consumer confidence is increasing. That stat, combined with the increase in more sensative industries suggests to me that these numbers are reflexive jitters, not responsive trends. Still troubling though.
