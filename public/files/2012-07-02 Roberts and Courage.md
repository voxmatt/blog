> I cannot say this is the moment the fever broke. The "movement right" is still furious at Roberts, pushing Romney as the principle-free instrument of their next round of institution-smashing (Medicare). But that a conservative placed the country's institutional stability before ideological fervor is so rare at this point it deserves some kind of praise. It's a start. If the GOP is beaten this fall, it may even be seen as the moment the tide began to turn, and conservatism began to reach back toward its less feral traditions and ideas. But I know I'm getting way ahead of myself here.

> But at some point, conservatism must re-emerge, if only because we so desperately need it. Conservatism is, after all, a philosophy that tends to argue that less equals more, that restraint is sometimes more powerful than action, that delay is often wiser than headlong revolution. It reveres traditional rules and existing institutions, especially endangered elite institutions that the Founders designed to checkÂ  and cool the popular will. Roberts took a small step toward resuscitating that tradition last week.

I think Sullivan is getting *a little* swept up in the moment here. After all, Roberts has been a reliable pen on the conservative wing of the court, much more so than Kennedy. But his stand is all the more heroic when one considers the pressures and expectations he operated under. While it is sad that standing up for long standing principles of constitutional democracy requires courage these days, at least there are still those willing to do it.
