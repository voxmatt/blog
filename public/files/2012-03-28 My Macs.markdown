The first Macintosh I remember really *using* was the [Macintosh LC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_LC). I remember playing with an Apple II [^1]:(I can't remember which, but it was likely a [II Plus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_Plus)), but the first Mac that I *used*—that I engaged—was the diminutively approachable LC.
