The Daily with more information on the curious casting:

> “He is already meeting with folks that knew Steve Jobs. He’s working with professionals to get inside the voice. He’s letting his hair grow out. I understand he’s canceled all meetings and actually canceled all other projects,” producer Mark Hulme, whose newly formed Five Star Feature Films is the sole investor behind “Jobs,” told Flash.

> “He believes the role was meant for him.”

Personally, I'm not sure I care. The odds that the script is any good in the first place seem pretty low. I do have to say, however, that the [resemblance](http://downloads.thedaily.com/ui-images/2012/04/03/040312-gossip-ashton-kutcher-1-ss-662w-at-1x.jpg) is *far* stronger than I would have thought.
